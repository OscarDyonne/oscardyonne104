            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Oscar Dyonne. I was born in May, 2001, in Orleans, France and I have French and British dual nationality. I am currently studying communication networks and cyberscience at the Technology College in Blois, in the Centre region of France. Before enrolling in this course, I studied mathematics and physics at the University of Orléans-La-Source. </p>
		<h2>Professional Project</h2>
		<p>Next academic year, I am considering studying cybersecurity, and hopefully pursuing my studies to a Master’s degree level. If all goes well, I would like to be able to start a professional career in the communication security field in five year’s time. I would be most interested in working for establishments like the French special intelligence service under the authority of the Ministry of Interior, or Interpol in France. I also find Big Tech companies such as BlackRock appealing for the career paths they can offer. 
Cybersecurity represents a challenge for me because you have to outwit malware and implement preventive action on a network. It is a field which is in constant evolution - what was true yesterday is often obsolete today. This means it is a position where you must always be alert and ready for anything that might happen.</p>
